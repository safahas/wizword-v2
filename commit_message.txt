[Cursor] Fix category randomization for 'any' selection and 'Another Word' button

- Preserve the user's original category choice (including 'any') in session state when starting a new game.
- Only resolve 'any' to a random category for the current game instance, not for session state.
- Update play again ('Another Word') logic to re-randomize the category if the user started with 'any', or keep the chosen category otherwise.
- This ensures that each new word after 'Another Word' will use a new random category if 'any' was selected, matching user expectations.
- Fixes issue where category would get stuck after the first randomization.
